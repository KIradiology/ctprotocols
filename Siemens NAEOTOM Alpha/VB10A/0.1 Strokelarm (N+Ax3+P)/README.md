# Stroke Imaging Protocol - "0.1 Strokelarm (N+Ax3+P)"

## Overview

This repository contains the imaging protocol used in our institution for rapid and comprehensive stroke imaging. The protocol, referred to as "0.1 Strokelarm (N+Ax3+P)", is designed to provide high-quality arterial imaging from the diaphragm to the vertex of the skull using a dual-source CT scanner. This protocol is optimized for speed and diagnostic accuracy, ensuring that critical stroke patients receive timely and precise imaging.
